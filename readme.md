## Posterlog

I started buying posters at concerts years ago and ammassed quite a collection of showbills, hatchprints, and posters from concerts and events. I built this app to keep track of them with high quality photos and details about the posters like their dimensions, condition, where I got them, and whether they're signed and numbered.  
This project is primarily intended as an app I can use to learn new technologies, hands on, with something I care about.

### Getting started

```
git clone git@github.com:gpspake/posterlog.git  
cd posterlog  
vagrant up  //don't forget to update your homestead.yaml and hosts file  
vagrant ssh  
cd posterlog  
composer install  
npm install  
bower install  
gulp  
```
